## About me üå∏

I‚Äôm a passionate developer with a diverse professional background in sales, customer service and computer electronics. My experience in sales has equipped me with strong communication and interpersonal skills, enabling me to effectively collaborate with clients and teams. Additionally, my customer service background taught me to prioritize user experience and resolve issues efficiently, which I apply when developing user-centric applications.

I am also a **Certified Computer Electronics Technician**, which gives me a unique perspective on hardware and software integration. While I haven‚Äôt worked extensively as a technician, my experience in first-line IT support has given me practical exposure to diagnosing and resolving technical issues, managing user expectations, and providing exceptional customer service.

These experiences have not only strengthened my problem-solving skills but also enabled me to approach development from a user-centric perspective, always considering how my solutions impact the end user. I aim to combine my technical knowledge, troubleshooting expertise, and passion for software development to build applications that are both efficient and user-friendly.
